          <p>Autotest is a prototype application investigating methods of web-application test automation, with an emphasis on tests for accessibility.</p>
          <h2 class="headText">What Autotest does</h2>
          <p>Your instructions to Autotest are in a <strong>script</strong>.</p>
          <p>A script follows rules documented below.</p>
          <p>Each script is stored in its own file, located in a scripts directory.</p>
          <p>The standard name for a scripts directory is <code>autotest-scripts</code>.</p>
          <p>The standard location for a scripts directory is next to the <code>autotest</code> directory.</p>
          <p>It is possible to have more than one scripts directory.</p>
          <p>When you run Autotest, you first give it the location and name of the scripts directory that you want it to use. Then Autotest shows you a list of the scripts in that directory. You choose a script. Then Autotest performs the actions specified in that script and outputs a report.</p>
          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>The rules for scripts will be here.</p>
