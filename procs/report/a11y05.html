      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This report summarizes findings of a battery of tests of the accessibility of a <a href="__url__">web page belonging to __org__</a>. This summary is based on a <a href="../data/__file__.json">file containing the results in JSON format</a>.</p>
      <h2>Test packages</h2>
      <h3>Axe</h3>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">Axe</a> is an open-source package sponsored by accessibility consulting firm Deque. All 138 of its default tests were performed. If this page failed any of the Axe tests, the failed tests are listed here:</p>
      <ul>
        __axeFailures__
      </ul>
      <p>The specific failures of Axe tests can be found in the section of the JSON file that begins with</p>
      <pre>      "type": "test",
        "which": "axe",</pre>
      <h3>Equal Access</h3>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access">Equal Access</a> is an open-source package sponsored by IBM Corporation. All 163 of its default tests were performed. If this page failed any of the Equal Access tests, the failed tests are listed here:</p>
      <ul>
        __ibmFailures__
      </ul>
      <p>The specific failures of Equal Access tests can be found in the section of the JSON file that begins with</p>
      <pre>      "type": "test",
        "which": "ibm",</pre>
      <h3>WAVE</h3>
      <p><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a> is a proprietary package owned by webAIM, a program of the Institute for Disability Research, Policy, and Practice at Utah State University. All 110 of its default tests were performed. If this page failed any of the WAVE tests, the failed tests are listed here:</p>
      <ul>
        __waveFailures__
      </ul>
      <p>The specific failures of WAVE tests can be found in the section of the JSON file that begins with</p>
      <pre>      "type": "test",
        "which": "wave",</pre>
      <h2>Custom tests</h2>
      <p>Although these three packages conduct a total of 411 tests, the tests are designed to detect only some, not all, accessibility problems. In general, these packages inspect the code of a web page, but they do not observe changes in a page, navigate within a page, or perform operations on a page. Some accessibility problems arise only over time, or only when a user performs an action (such as pressing a key, hovering, or clicking). I have created more tests and included them in this procedure to detect some problems not detected by the test packages.</p>
      <h3><code>bulk</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>bulk</code> test counts the initially visible elements in a page. The motivation for this test is the frustration that users with visual and motor disabilities (and not only they) often express with content bloat. A complex, busy page usually makes it difficult to know what the page is about, whether it is relevant, and how to find a specific thing there. This procedure begins to assign a deficit when the count exceeds 250. The count for this page was __bulkCount__. Obviously, it requires judgment, and perhaps user research, to determine whether this reflects practical accessibility.</p>
      <h3><code>embAc</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>embAc</code> test detects improper embedding of interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs, and select lists) within links or buttons. Such embedding not only violates the HTML standard, but also complicates user interaction and creates risks of error. It becomes non-obvious what a user will activate with a click.</p>
      <p>If this page failed the <code>embAc</code> test, the counts of embedded interactive elements are listed here:</p>
      <ul>
        __embAcFailures__
      </ul>
      <p>The specific failures of the <code>embAc</code>> test can be found in the section of the JSON file that begins with</p>
      <pre>      "type": "test",
        "which": "embAc",</pre>
      <h3><code>focAll</code></h3>
      <p>The <code>focAll</code> test detects discrepancies between focusable and Tab-focused element counts. The test first counts all the visible Tab-focusable (i.e. with tabIndex 0) elements (except counting each group of radio buttons as only one focusable element). In principle, by pressing the Tab key a user should be able to reach (i.e. focus) each of those elements. Then the test repeatedly presses the Tab (or Option-Tab in the webkit browser) key until it has focused all the elements it can and counts those elements. If the latter are more than the former, Tab-key navigation made more focusable elements visible. If the latter are fewer than the former, the page managed focus so as to prevent Tab-key navigation from focusing all the elements it would normally be able to focus. Either of these can complicate navigation for users. It may disappoint the expectation that the content will remain stable as they move with the Tab key, or the expectation that they can reach every focusable element (or widget, such as one radio button or tab in each group) merely by pressing the Tab key. This problem is acute for users who must use only a keyboard (not a mouse) or a keyboard-emulating assistive device to navigate.</p>
      <p>If this page failed the <code>focAll</code> test, the counts of focusable and focused elements are listed here:</p>
      <ul>
        __focAllFailures__
